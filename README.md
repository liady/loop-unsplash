##  Description
This project displays a modal that allows the user to search for an image on Unsplash. Once the image is selected, it is displayed in the background.
A history of searches and selections is kept and can be viewed by the user, as well as be searched again.
When the user clicks the image in the back, it can be shared to Twitter.

##  Running Locally
This project has a server side (for the Unsplash API) and a client app (React & Vite).
To run the project locally, you can use the following commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run server
npm dev
```
